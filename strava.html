            <h1>Analysing Strava running data
in Python<br /></h1>
          </header>
<h3 style="margin-top: 30px">🎯 Goal and Research Questions</h3>
<p>The goal of this project was to analyze personal running activity data to understand trends, performance improvements, and training patterns over time. Key research questions included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How has the total distance and frequency of runs changed over time?</li>
  <li>Has my average running pace improved, and what trends can be observed in pace and heart rate?</li>
  <li>How do variables like distance, elapsed time, and heart rate relate to one another?</li>
  <li>Are there noticeable outliers or anomalies in performance, and what might explain them?</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 30px">📊 Data Sources</h3>
<p>The dataset comes from personal activity tracking and contains 214 entries across 94 columns. For this analysis, a subset of meaningful variables was used, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Activity date and type</li>
  <li>Elapsed time and moving time</li>
  <li>Distance and average pace</li>
  <li>Average and maximum heart rate</li>
  <li>Calories and total steps</li>
</ul>
<p>All data was imported in CSV format and loaded into Python for cleaning, transformation, and analysis.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 30px">🔄 Process (ETL, Transformations, Exploration)</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: 30px">🔧 ETL and Transformations </h4>

<ul>
  <li>Selected only relevant columns for running activities.</li>
  <li>Handled missing values: calories were imputed based on similar distances; rows with missing average heart rate were dropped.</li>
  <li>Converted dates to <code>datetime</code> objects and extracted day, month, year, and time.</li>
  <li>Converted elapsed and moving times to minutes and calculated average pace (<code>moving time / distance</code>).</li>
  <li>Detected and noted outliers, particularly in average pace, corresponding to early walk/run sessions.</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top: 30px">🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Visualized pairwise relationships between distance, average pace, heart rate, and elapsed time.</li>
  <li>Examined correlations: faster paces corresponded with higher heart rates; longer distances led to longer elapsed times.</li>
  <li>Tracked total distance per month and year to identify trends in training volume.</li>
  <li>Calculated a 10-run rolling average of pace to smooth fluctuations and detect long-term improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 30px">📈 Results and Findings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Average run duration was ~43 minutes, covering ~5.7 km at a pace of ~7.5 min/km.</li>
  <li>Most runs ranged between 3.8–6.3 km, with heart rate averaging 145 bpm and peaks up to 168 bpm.</li>
  <li>Step counts ranged around 6,800 per run, reaching >26,000 during long sessions.</li>
  <li>Total running distance increased significantly from 2024 to early 2025, with March 2025 being the highest month (~100+ km).</li>
  <li>Rolling average pace improved over time, dropping from ~10 min/km in early sessions to ~7 min/km by early 2025, indicating endurance and performance improvements.</li>
  <li>Temporary increases in pace occurred during longer runs (half-marathon preparation), reflecting strategic low-intensity training.</li>
  <li>Outliers in pace were explained by early walk/run sessions and training adaptations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 30px">⚠️ Limitations and Future Work</h3>
<ul>
  <h4> Limitations:</h4> <li>Dataset only reflects personal running activity, limiting generalizability. </li>
  <li>Some data points were missing (e.g., calories, heart rate), requiring imputation or removal. </li> <li>Analysis does not incorporate external factors such as weather, terrain, or fatigue levels.</li> </ul>
 <ul><h4> Future Work:</h4> <li> Include additional metrics such as heart rate zones, elevation gain, or running surface
    <li>Apply predictive models to estimate performance improvement or injury risk</li>
       <li>Visualize seasonal and weekly training patterns; compare running efficiency and pace progression relative to training interventions (e.g., zone 2 workouts, long runs).</li>
</ul>
